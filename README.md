# Mapping_Earthquakes

Using Leaflet.js, HTML, and JavaScript to populate an interactive geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data.

## Overview

The purpose of the project was to visually depict earthquakes all across the globe based off of their magnitude. Data was pulled from the USGS website using GeoJSON. All earthquakes depicted occurred over the last 7 calendar days. Once the data is pulled, it is added to the map, which will automatically update with up-to-date earthquake data as USGS updates it on their end.

Different styles of map can be toggled through by the user based on their preference. There is also a legend and ability to view tectonic plates, all earthquakes, and more specifically, major earthquakes.
